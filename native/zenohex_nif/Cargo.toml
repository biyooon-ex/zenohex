# version
#   When updating the Zenoh version, make sure to update the Rust version
#   in `rust-toolchain.toml` to match the one used in the Zenoh repository.
#   Zenoh plugins are compiled using this version, and a mismatch will prevent plugins from being loaded.
# features
#   zenoh::session::EntityGlobalId needs "unstable"
#   "plugins" needs "unstable" and "internal"
